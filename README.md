# Yulav Fish Repository
One of my best friends started a fish business. He buys, breeds, grows and sells them. He's doing it all on one leg.

I wanted to take a part of his amazing work, so I built a system to help him track his inventory and profits.

I created an inventory management system using c#.Net, Sql server and visual studio.

The Application allows to:

*Create, delete and update fish types  
*Create, delete and update fish species  
*Add Orders  
*Calculate net profits  
*Calculate dead fish % and update fish quantity   
*Quantity is updated when order is placed
